# Access control

Braintrust has a robust and flexible access control system.
It's possible to grant user permissions at both the organization level as well
as scoped to individual objects within Braintrust (projects, experiments, logs, datasets, prompts, and playgrounds).

## Permission Groups

The core concept of Braintrust's access control system is the permission group. Permission groups are collections of users that can be granted specific permissions.
Braintrust has three pre-configured Permission Groups that are scoped to the organization.

1. **Owners** - Unrestricted access to the organization, its data, and its settings. Can add, modify, and delete projects and all other resources. Can invite and remove members and can manage group membership.
2. **Engineers** - Can access, create, update, and delete projects and all resources within projects. Cannot invite or remove members or manage access to resources.
3. **Viewers** - Can access projects and all resources within projects. Cannot create, update, or delete any resources. Cannot invite or remove members or manage access to resources.

If your access control needs are simple and you do not need to restrict access to individual projects, these ready-made permission groups may be all that you need.

A new user can be added to one of these three groups when you invite them to your organization.

## Creating custom permission groups

In addition to the built-in permission groups, it's possible to create your own groups as well.
To do so, go to the 'Permission groups' page of Settings and click on the 'Create permission group' button.
Give your group a name and a description and then click 'Create'.

To set organization-level permissions for your new group, find the group in the groups list and click on the Permissions button.

<Callout type="info">
  The 'Manage Access' permission should be granted judiciously as it is a
  super-user permission. It gives the user the ability to add and remove
  permissions, thus any user with 'Manage Access' gains the ability to grant all
  other permissions to themselves. \ \ The 'Manage Settings' permission grants
  users the ability to change organization-level settings like the API URL.
</Callout>

## Project scoped permissions

To limit access to a specific project, create a new permission group from the Settings page.
![Project level permissions](./access-control/create-project-level.png)

Navigate to the Configuration page of that project, and click on the Permissions link in the context menu.

![Project level permissions](./access-control/project-level-permissions.png)

Search for your group by typing in the text input at the top of the page, and then click the pencil icon next to the group to set permissions.
![Search for group](./access-control/search-for-group.png)

Set the project-level permissions for your group and click Save.

## Object scoped permissions

To limit access to a particular object (experiment, dataset, log, prompt, or playground) within a project, first create a permission group for those users on the 'Permission groups' section of Settings.
![Create experiment level group](./access-control/create-experiment-level-group.png)

Next, navigate to the Configuration page of the project that holds that object and grant the group 'Read' permission at the project level.
This will allow users in that group to navigate to the project in the Braintrust UI.

Finally, navigate to your object and select Permissions from the context menu in the top-right of that object's page.
![Experiment level project permissions](./access-control/experiment-level-permissions-link.png)

Find the permission group via the search input, and click the pencil icon to set permissions for the group.
![Experiment level find group](./access-control/experiment-level-find-group.png)

Set the desired permissions for the group scoped to this specific object.

## API support

If you need to automate the creation of permission groups and their access control rules, you can use the Braintrust API.
The documentation for operating on permission groups via the API is [here](/docs/reference/api#list-groups).
The documentation for manipulating permissions is [here](/docs/reference/api#list-acls).
