    "Large language models can sometimes feel unpredictable, where small changes to a prompt can dramatically change the quality and tone of generated responses. In customer support, this is especially important, since customer satisfaction, brand tone, and the clarity of solutions offered all rely on consistent, high-quality prompts. Optimizing this process involves creating a couple variations, measuring their effectiveness, and sometimes returning to previous versions that performed better.\n",

Starting with a basic implementation, we'll create increasingly sophisticated prompts, keep track of different versions, evaluate their performance, and switch back to earlier versions when necessary.\n"
