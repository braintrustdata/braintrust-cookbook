    "These types of chat bots have become important parts of applications, acting as customer service agents, sales representatives, or travel agents, to name a few. As an owner of such an application, it's important to be sure the bot provides value to the user.\n",

    "We will expand on this below, but the history and context of a conversation is crucial in being able to produce a good response. If you received a request to \"Make a dinner reservation at 7pm\" and you knew where, on what date, and for how many people, you could provide some assistance; otherwise, you'd need to ask for more information.\n",
