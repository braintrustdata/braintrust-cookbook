    "# Evaluating SimpleQA\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to evaluate a simple QA system in Braintrust using [SimpleQA](https://openai.com/index/introducing-simpleqa/), an open-source dataset from OpenAI. We'll also use [autoevals](https://github.com/braintrustdata/autoevals), our built-in library for evaluating AI model outputs. By the time you finish this example, you'll learn how to define and use custom evaluation metrics, compare evals that use different models, and analyze results in Braintrust."

    "\n",
    "Before getting started, make sure you have a [Braintrust account](https://www.braintrust.dev/signup) and an API key for [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/). Make sure to plug the OpenAI key into your Braintrust account's [AI providers](https://www.braintrust.dev/app/settings?subroute=secrets) configuration and acquire a [BRAINTRUST_API_KEY](https://www.braintrust.dev/app/settings?subroute=api-keys). In this cookbook, we'll be comparing GPT-4o to Claude 3.5 Sonnet, so if you'd like to follow along, add an API key for [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/) to your Braintrust account as well. Or, you can add an API key for any other AI provider you'd like and follow the same process. Lastly, add your `BRAINTRUST_API_KEY` to your Python environment, or just hardcode it into the code below.\n",

    "- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n",
    "    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n",
    "    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n",
    "    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n",
    "- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n",
    "    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n",
    "- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n",
    "    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n",
    "    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n",
    "    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n",
    "    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n",
    "- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n",
    "    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n",
