    "# Using Assertions to validate complex chatbot criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "![Zapier x Braintrust](./assets/header.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Zapier](https://zapier.com/) is the #1 workflow automation platform for small and midsize businesses, connecting to more than 6000 of the most popular work apps. We were also one of the first companies to build and ship AI features into our core products. We've had the opportunity to work with Braintrust since the early days of the product, which now powers the evaluation and observability infrastructure across our AI features.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of Zapier is the wide range of integrations that we support. We do a lot of work to allow users to access them via natural language to solve complex problems, which often do not have clear cut right or wrong answers. Instead, we define a set of criteria that need to be met (assertions). Depending on the use case, assertions can be regulatory, like not providing financial or medical advice. In other cases, they help us make sure the model invokes the right external services instead of hallucinating a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing assertions and evaluating them in Braintrust, we've seen a 60%+ improvement in our quality metrics. This tutorial walks through how to create and validate assertions, so you can use them for your own tool-using chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to create a chatbot that has access to a single tool, _weather lookup_, and throw a series of questions at it. Some questions will involve the weather and others won't. We'll use assertions to validate that the chatbot only invokes the weather lookup tool when it's appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a simple request handler and hook up a weather tool to it.\n"
