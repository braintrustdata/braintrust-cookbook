    "# Benchmarking providers\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are a small handful of open-source LLMs, there are a variety of inference providers that can host them for you, each with different cost,\n",
    "speed, and as we'll see below, accuracy trade-offs. And even if one provider excels at a certain model size, it may not be the best choice for another.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "It's very important to evaluate your specific use case against a variety of both models and providers to make an informed decision about which to use.\n",
    "What I learned is that the results are pretty unpredictable and vary across both provider and model size. Just because one provider has a good 8b model,\n",
    "doesn't mean that its 405b is fast or accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things that surprised me:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **8b models are consistently fast, but have high variance in accuracy**\n",
    "- **One provider is fastest for 8b and 70b, yet slowest for 405b**\n",
    "- **The best provider is different across the two benchmarks we ran**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully this analysis will help you create your own benchmarks and make an informed decision about which provider to use.\n"

    "Let's start by looking at the project view. Braintrust makes it easy to morph this into a multi-level grouped analysis where we can see the score vs. duration in a scatter plot, and how each provider stacks up in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Setting up the table](./assets/configuring-graph.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's dig into this chart and see what we can learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **70b hits a nice sweet spot**\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks like on average, each weight class costs you an extra second on average. However, the jump in average accuracy from 8b to 70b is 16%+ while\n",
    "70b to 405b is only 2.87%.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pivot table](./assets/aggregate-tradeoff.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **8b models are consistently really fast, but some providers' 70b models are slower than others'**\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution among providers for 8b latency is very tight, but that starts to change with 70b and even more so with 405b models.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Speed distribution](./assets/speed-variance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **High accuracy variance in 8b models**\n",
    "\n",
    "Within 8b models in particular, there is a pretty significant difference in accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "![Accuracy distribution](./assets/performance-variance-8b.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Provider 1 is the fastest except for 405b**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Provider 1](./assets/provider-1-insight.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, provider 1's 8b model is both the fastest and most accurate. However, its 405b model, while accurate, is the slowest by far. This is likely due to\n",
    "rate limits, or perhaps they have optimized it using a different method.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Self-hosting strikes a nice balance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-hosting strikes a nice balance between latency and quality (note: we only tested self-hosted 405b). Of course, this comes at a price -- around $27/hour using [Lambda Labs](https://lambdalabs.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Self-hosted](./assets/self-hosted.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Another benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "We also used roughly the same code on a different, more-realistic, internal benchmark which measures how well our [AI search](https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/cookbook/recipes/AISearch) bar works. Here is the same\n",
    "visualization for that benchmark:\n",
    "\n",
    "![AISearch](./assets/ai-search.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, certain things are consistent, but others are not. Again, this highlights how important it is to run this analysis on your own use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Provider 1 is less differentiated**. Although Provider 1 is still the fastest, it comes at the cost of accuracy in the 70b and 405b classes, where Provider 2 wins on accuracy. Provider 2 also wins on speed for 405b.\n",
    "- **Provider 3 has a hard time in the 70b class**. This workload is heavy on prompt tokens (~3500 per test case). Maybe that has something to do with it?\n",
    "- **More latency variance across the board**. Again, this may have to do with the significant jump in prompt tokens.\n",
    "- **Self-hosted seems to be about the same**. Interestingly, the self-hosted model appears at about the same spot in the graph!\n"
