        "\n",
        "[Evalion](https://www.evalion.ai) is a voice-agent evaluation platform that simulates real user interactions and normalizes results across scenarios, enabling teams to detect regressions, compare runs over time, and validate an agent’s readiness for production. Their platform enables teams to test voice agents by creating autonomous testing agents that conduct realistic conversations: interrupting mid-sentence, changing their mind, and expressing frustration just like real customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "This cookbook demonstrates how to evaluate voice agents by combining Evalion's simulation capabilities with Braintrust. Voice agents require assessment beyond simple text accuracy: they must handle real-time latency constraints (< 500ms responses), manage interruptions gracefully, maintain context across multi-turn conversations, and deliver natural-sounding interactions.\n",
