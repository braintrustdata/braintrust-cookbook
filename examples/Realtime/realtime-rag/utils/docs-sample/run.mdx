# Run evals

Braintrust allows you to create evaluations directly in your code, and run them in your development workflow
or CI/CD pipeline. Once you have defined one or more evaluations, you can run them using the `braintrust eval` command. This command will run all evaluations in the specified files and directories. As they run, they will automatically
log results to Braintrust and display a summary in your terminal.

<CodeTabs>

<TSTab>
```bash
npx braintrust eval basic.eval.ts
```

```bash
npx braintrust eval [file or directory] [file or directory] ...
```

The `braintrust eval` command uses the Next.js convention to load environment variables from:

- `env.development.local`
- `.env.local`
- `env.development`
- `.env`

</TSTab>

<PYTab>
```bash
braintrust eval eval_basic.py
```

```bash
braintrust eval [file or directory] [file or directory] ...
```

</PYTab>
</CodeTabs>

## Watch mode

You can run evaluations in watch-mode by passing the `--watch` flag. This will re-run evaluations whenever any of
the files they depend on change.

## Github action

Once you get the hang of running evaluations, you can integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically
run them on every pull request or commit. This workflow allows you to catch eval regressions early and often.

The [`braintrustdata/eval-action`](https://github.com/braintrustdata/eval-action) action allows you to run
evaluations directly in your Github workflow. Each time you run an evaluation, the action automatically posts
a comment:

![action comment](./github-actions-comment.png)

To use the action, simply include it in a workflow yaml file (`.github/workflows`):

## Run code directly

Although you can invoke `Eval()` functions via the `braintrust eval` command, you can also call them directly in your code.

<CodeTabs>

<TSTab>

```typescript
import { Factuality } from "autoevals";
import { Eval } from "braintrust";

async function main() {
  const result = await Eval("Say Hi Bot", {
    data: () => [
      {
        input: "David",
        expected: "Hi David",
      },
    ],
    task: (input) => {
      return "Hi " + input;
    },
    scores: [Factuality],
  });
  console.log(result);
}

main();
```

In TypeScript, `Eval()` is an async function that returns a `Promise`. You can run `Eval()`s concurrently
and wait for all of them to finish using `Promise.all()`.

</TSTab>

<PYTab>

```python
from braintrust import Eval

from autoevals import Factuality


def main():
    result = Eval(
        "Say Hi Bot",
        data=lambda: [
            {
                "input": "David",
                "expected": "Hi David",
            },
        ],
        task=lambda input: "Hi " + input,
        scores=[Factuality],
    )
    print(result)


async def main():
    result = await Eval(
        "Say Hi Bot",
        data=lambda: [
            {
                "input": "David",
                "expected": "Hi David",
            },
        ],
        task=lambda input: "Hi " + input,
        scores=[Factuality],
    )
    print(result)
```

In Python, `Eval()` returns a `Future` if it is called in an async context, and a `Result` if it is called in a
synchronous context. It is safe to run `Eval()`s concurrently in both async and sync contexts.

Generally speaking, Jupyter notebooks are async, so you should use `await Eval(...)`.

## Limiting concurrency

Sometimes, due to rate limits or other constraints, you may want to limit the number of concurrent evaluations in an
`Eval()` call. Each `Eval()` lets you define `maxConcurrency`/`max_concurrency` to limit the number of concurrent
test cases that run.

<CodeTabs>

<TSTab>
```typescript
import { Factuality, Levenshtein } from "autoevals";
import { Eval } from "braintrust";

Eval("Say Hi Bot", {
  data: () =>
    Array.from({ length: 100 }, (_, i) => ({
      input: `${i}`,
      expected: `${i + 1}`,
    })),
  task: (input) => {
    return input + 1;
  },
  scores: [Factuality, Levenshtein],
  maxConcurrency: 5, // Run 5 tests concurrently
});
```
</TSTab>

<PYTab>
```python
from braintrust import Eval

from autoevals import Factuality, Levenstein

result = Eval(
    "Test",
    data=lambda: [{"input": f"{i}", "expected": f"{i + 1}"} for i in range(100)],
    task=lambda input: str(int(input) + 1),
    scores=[Factuality, Levenstein],
    max_concurrency=5,  # Run 5 tests concurrently
)
```
</PYTab>
</CodeTabs>

## Troubleshooting

### Stack traces

By default, the evaluation framework swallows errors in individual tasks, reports them to Braintrust,
and prints a single line per error to the console. If you want to see the full stack trace for each
error, you can pass the `--verbose` flag.

### Why are my scores getting averaged?

Braintrust organizes your data into traces, each of which is a row in the experiments table. Within a trace,
if you log the same score multiple times, it will be averaged in the table. This is a useful way to collect an overall
measurement, e.g. if you compute the relevance of each retrieved document in a RAG use case, and want to see the overall
relevance. However, if you want to see each score individually, you have a few options:

- Split the input into multiple independent traces, and log each score in a separate trace. The [trials](#trials) feature
  will naturally average the results at the top-level, but allow you to view each individual output as a separate test case.
- Compute a separate score for each instance. For example, if you have exactly 3 documents you retrieve every time, you may want
  to compute a separate score for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd position.
- Create separate experiments for each thing you're trying to score. For example, you may want to try out two different models and
  compute a score for each. In this case, if you split into separate experiments, you'll be able to diff across experiments and compare
  outputs side-by-side.

### Node bundling errors (e.g. "cannot be marked as external")

The `.eval.ts` files are bundled in a somewhat limiting way, via `esbuild` and a special set of
build options that work in most cases, but not all. For example, if you have any `export` statements
in them, you may see errors like "cannot be marked as external".

You can usually fix this specific error by removing `export` statements. However, if that does not work,
or you want more control over how the files are bundled, you can also just run the files directly.
`Eval` is an async function, so you can just call it directly in a script:

```bash
npx tsx my-app.eval.ts
```
