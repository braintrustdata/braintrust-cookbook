# Evaluate via SDK

When you arrive in a new organization, you will see these steps. They tell you how to run your first experiment:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Install Braintrust libraries

First, install the Braintrust SDK (TypeScript, Python and API wrappers in [other languages](/docs/reference/api#api-wrappers)).

<CodeTabs>
<TSTab>
```bash
npm install braintrust autoevals
```

or

```bash
yarn add braintrust autoevals
```

<Callout type="warn">Node version >= 18 is required</Callout>
</TSTab>

<PYTab>
```bash
pip install braintrust autoevals
```
</PYTab>
</CodeTabs>
</Step>

<Step>
### Create a simple evaluation script

The eval framework allows you to declaratively define evaluations in your code. Inspired by tools like Jest, you can define a set of evaluations in files named _.eval.ts or _.eval.js (Node.js) or eval\_\*.py (Python).

Create a file named `tutorial.eval.ts` or `eval_tutorial.py` with the following code.

<CodeTabs>
<TSTab>
```typescript
import { Eval } from "braintrust";
import { Levenshtein } from "autoevals";

Eval(
  "Say Hi Bot", // Replace with your project name
  {
    data: () => {
      return [
        {
          input: "Foo",
          expected: "Hi Foo",
        },
        {
          input: "Bar",
          expected: "Hello Bar",
        },
      ]; // Replace with your eval dataset
    },
    task: async (input) => {
      return "Hi " + input; // Replace with your LLM call
    },
    scores: [Levenshtein],
  },
);
```
</TSTab>
<PYTab>
```python
from braintrust import Eval

from autoevals import Levenshtein

Eval(
    "Say Hi Bot",  # Replace with your project name
    data=lambda: [
        {
            "input": "Foo",
            "expected": "Hi Foo",
        },
        {
            "input": "Bar",
            "expected": "Hello Bar",
        },
    ],  # Replace with your eval dataset
    task=lambda input: "Hi " + input,  # Replace with your LLM call
    scores=[Levenshtein],
)
```
</PYTab>
</CodeTabs>

This script sets up the basic scaffolding of an evaluation:

- `data` is an array or iterator of data you'll evaluate
- `task` is a function that takes in an input and returns an output
- `scores` is an array of scoring functions that will be used to score the tasks's output

(You can also write your own code. Make sure to follow the naming conventions for your language. TypeScript
files should be named `*.eval.ts` and Python files should be named `eval_*.py`.)

</Step>

<Step>
### Create an API key

Next, create an API key to authenticate your evaluation script. You can create an API key in the [settings page](https://www.braintrust.dev/app/settings?subroute=api-keys).

</Step>

<Step>
### Run your evaluation script

Run your evaluation script with the following command:

<CodeTabs>
<TSTab>
```bash
BRAINTRUST_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
npx braintrust eval tutorial.eval.ts
```
</TSTab>
<PYTab>
```bash
BRAINTRUST_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
braintrust eval eval_tutorial.py
```
</PYTab>
</CodeTabs>

This will create an experiment in Braintrust. Once the command runs, you'll see a link to your experiment.

</Step>

<Step>
### View your results

Congrats, you just ran an eval! You should see a dashboard like this when you load your experiment.
This view is called the _experiment view_, and as you use Braintrust, we hope it becomes your trusty companion
each time you change your code and want to run an eval.

The experiment view allows you to look at high level metrics for performance, dig
into individual examples, and compare your LLM app's performance over time.

</Step>

<Step>
### Run another experiment

After running your first evaluation, you’ll see that we achieved a 77.8% score. Can you adjust the evaluation to improve this score? Make your changes and re-run the evaluation to track your progress.
