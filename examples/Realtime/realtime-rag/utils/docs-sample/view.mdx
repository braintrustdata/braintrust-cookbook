# View traces

To view a trace, select a log from your project's **Logs** page, or from an experiment on the **Evaluations** page. The trace will open on the right-hand side of your screen.

To get a closer look, select **Toggle fullscreen trace**.

Inside of your trace, you'll see a tree view of all of the spans that make up the trace.

You can select an individual span to see the metrics, input, output, expected, metadata, and activity.

## Span search

Often, you'll have a large number of spans inside of a given trace. To make it easier to locate a specific span or set of spans, you can search through your trace by selecting the magnifying glass icon.

### Span filtering

Once you've entered a search query, you can also filter the results of your search by span type or span field.

### Bulk selection

When you're ready to add specific spans to a dataset, you can bulk select them to add them to a new or existing dataset in your project.

## Diffing traces

When you're digging into traces in an experiment, you can toggle **Diff** view to compare across experiments, as well as output vs expected values.
